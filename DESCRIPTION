Description: GIS is one of epidemiology's bestest friends. Sadly, GIS data can also be a pain. Your shape file broke ? Bummer. None of the shape names match anything ? Ouch. The local government just restructured the administrative divisions and now all your work is useless ? Sad face. This package doesn't really fix all those issues, but it *is* designed as a data repository of GIS data for Epicentre where the shapes and names have been vetted to match what appears in other datasets. With `epimaps` you can easily load your map data into whichever project you want and avoid constant name validation scripts that exacerbate the risk of future failure.
